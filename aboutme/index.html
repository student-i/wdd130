    <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
    <p>I am a Software Engineering major. 
        With this major, I am going to be spending the rest of my life creating code. I am excited to be learning.
        how to do create websites. I know that this will likely be something that I do many times during any potential career knowing these.
        things I will be able to have a wider range of skills for the future. </p>
    <p> A couple of my hobbies are painting and writing. I like looking at and creating beauty in the world.
        I am not married. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my whole life. One of the quotes I like from general authorities
        is from the October 2022 general Conference from Elder Ryan K Olsen. He said "No matter how difficult or confusing the challenges may be,
        you can always remember that the answer is simple: it is always Jesus."
